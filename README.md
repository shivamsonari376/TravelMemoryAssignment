# **MERN Stack Application Deployment**

## **Overview**
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to deploying a MERN stack application on AWS using EC2 instances, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Cloudflare for DNS and domain management. 

### **Key Details**
- **Load Balancer DNS:** `ShivamTMALB-192579021.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Domain:** `theshiv.xyz`

---

## **Deployment Architecture**
Below is the deployment architecture  for this setup:

[Deployment Architecture]

The architecture includes:
1. A front-end and back-end MERN stack application hosted on multiple EC2 instances (using AMIs for replication).
2. An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for distributing traffic across instances.
3. **Cloudflare** for DNS and domain management, pointing to the load balancer endpoint.
4. Custom domain registration via GoDaddy.

---

## **Steps to Deploy the Application**

### **1. Initial EC2 Setup**
1. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
   - Use Amazon Linux as the AMI.
   - Assign a security group with HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) access.
   - SSH into the instance.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install Node.js, NPM
   - Use the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y
     sudo yum install -y nodejs npm git
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone your MERN application repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/TravelMemory
     cd TravelMemory
     ```

4. **Configure the Backend:**
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database connection string and application settings.

5. **Start the Application:**
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```
   - Ensure the backend is running on port 3000.

6. **Set Up the Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Update the `urls.js` file to point to your backend API endpoint.
   - Build the production frontend files:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run build
     ```

7. **Configure Nginx:**
   - Set up a reverse proxy using Nginx to route traffic:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install -y nginx
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```
   - Example configuration:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;

         location /api/ {
             proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
         }

         location / {
             root /path/to/frontend/build;
             index index.html;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Restart Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

---

### **2. Create an AMI and Launch Additional Instances**
1. **Create an AMI:**
   - Once the application is running, create an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** of the configured EC2 instance.

2. **Launch New Instances:**
   - Launch two additional instances using the created AMI.
   - Assign the same security group to all instances.

3. **Verify:**
   - SSH into the instances to verify the application is running.

---

### **3. Configure Load Balancing**
1. **Create a Target Group:**
   - Name: `shivam1TMTG`.
   - Target type: `Instances`.
   - Protocol: HTTP.
   - Health Check Path: `/`.

2. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
   - Name: `shivamTMALB`.
   - Listener: HTTP on port 80.
   - Add `shivam1TMTG` as the target group.

3. **Test the Load Balancer:**
   - Access the ALB DNS endpoint (`ShivamTMALB-192579021.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`) in a browser to confirm it routes traffic to your instances.

---

### **4. Configure Domain with Cloudflare**
1. **Add Your Domain to Cloudflare:**
   - Log in to your Cloudflare account and add `theshiv.xyz`.
   - Copy the nameservers provided by Cloudflare.

2. **Update Nameservers in GoDaddy:**
   - Log in to your GoDaddy account and update the domainâ€™s nameservers with those from Cloudflare.

3. **Add DNS Records in Cloudflare:**
   - Create a **CNAME record**:
     - Name: `www`
     - Target: `ShivamTMALB-192579021.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.
   - Create an **A record**:
     - Name: `@`
     - Value: The public IP of one of the instances (optional if the ALB handles all traffic).

4. **Verify Domain:**
   - Visit `theshiv.xyz` in a browser to ensure your application is accessible.

---

## **Final Outcome**
- The MERN stack application is now successfully deployed and accessible via your custom domain: [theshiv.xyz](http://theshiv.xyz).

---

## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Application Not Loading:**
   - Check ALB health checks to ensure the instances are marked as healthy.
   - Verify DNS records in Cloudflare.
   - Check the Nginx configuration on the EC2 instances.

2. **Environment Variables Missing:**
   - Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured and sourced during deployment.

3. **Scaling Issues:**
   - Verify the instances are added to the correct target group.
